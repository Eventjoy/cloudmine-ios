This is the native iOS SDK for CloudMine. It uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and is thus **compatible only with XCode 4.1 or higher and iOS 4 or higher.**

It has the following dependencies:

* CFNetwork
* SystemConfiguration
* MobileCoreServices
* CoreGraphics
* UIKit
* libz

Watch the introductory [screencast](http://localhost:3000/developer_zone#ios/tutorials) to see how to set up a new iOS project in XCode using the CloudMine framework, including how to specify all the dependencies.

Please see the [documentation overview](http://cloudmine.me/developer_zone#ios/overview) on our website for more details.
